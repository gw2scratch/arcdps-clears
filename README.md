# arcdps clears
A plugin for arcdps which adds a window for quickly checking your current weekly clears in the game.

This plugin uses the official Guild Wars 2 API to get the clear data, you will need an [API key](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:API_key) (with access to *account* and *progression*).

The plugin uses no actual arcdps combat data, so it is the same as your typical overlay program â€“ no need to worry about breaking any rules.

## Current State

Please note, this is currently a very early version. It's already useful to me, so I am releasing it as it is.
However, there are some extra things that I want to add in the future.

- There is currently no support for clears of alt accounts
- There is currently no support for clears of friends (the tab does nothing right now)

## Translations

You can make a custom translation for the text and the short boss names, should they not be to your liking.

To do so, create an `arcdps_lang_clears.json` file in the `addons/arcdps` directory (next to `arcdps.log`, `settings_clears.json` and others).
You should use the [default translation](translations/arcdps_lang_clears.json) as a base.

If you make a translation to a different language, let us know, we will feature it here.

## Contributing

You currently don't want to. At least not code.

This plugin is in very early stages and uses tooling that is different from most arcdps plugins.
It is written in Rust, and as of writing, the repository does not contain all the code required
to build the project (it's missing arcdps plugin bindings by Greaka, which will make it to crates.io eventually).
