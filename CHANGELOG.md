## arcdps clears 0.1.0
Please note, this is currently a very early version. It's already useful to me, so I am releasing it as it is. However, there are some extra things that I want to add in the future.

- There is currently no support for clears of alt accounts
- There is currently no support for clears of friends (the tab does nothing right now)
